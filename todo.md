- redesign a bit, ensure it works on mobile
- moving after search returns strange results in the listing
- ability to reorder folders (or at least sort them alphabetically)
- larger checkboxes, or ability to click on the whole row
- fix/remove any todos
- the api token never gets generated
- after registration, user is redirected to 'home', which doesn't exist
- api_token is very insecure
